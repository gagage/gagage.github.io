In frameworks of USAID REAP project, “Agro Solutions” conducted the research about potential of almond market in Georgia. According to the research, Georgia has an opportunity to become one of the leading countries in almond production. Based on this research, was identified that from about total 10 hectares of almond orchards in 2015 it grew to 900 hectares by recent data and this figure starts to grow annually. &nbsp;&nbsp;

This led Georgia to fall under the radars of foreign investors; Those investors already conducted studies on risk factors and opportunities of almond production in Georgia. Several regions of eastern Georgia have been identified to have excellent climate and soil conditions to grow particular commercial varieties of almonds.

Taking in consideration all this potential, “Agro Solutions” founded “Georgian Almond Growers Association” with the aims to support Georgia to become a leading almond production country in the world.
